# Problem Statement

Most educational institutions do not have a reliable or centralized system to manage their alumni data. Once students graduate, their contact information, academic records, and career updates are often scattered across multiple platforms or lost entirely. In many cases, alumni communication is restricted to informal WhatsApp groups or outdated mailing lists, making long-term
engagement difficult.

This lack of a structured system limits the potential of alumni relationships. Institutions miss opportunities to involve alumni in events, mentoring, internships, or fundraising. In a digitally connected world, the absence of a proper alumni management system creates a significant gap in outreach and growth.

# Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

- Strengthens alumni engagement
and builds long-term institutional relationships.

mentorship, internships, and collaborations.
- Enhances fundraising potential
through better alumni outreach.

credibility and community building.

# Expected Outcomes

# Ideas/Module

- To make a centralized app for the universities or colleges where students and alumni can connect to communicate for references, future guidance, and other activities. Student can interact with the each other and alumni to boost the productivity it is all in one aap for the connection of students, alumni, teachers and also government can comes in picture
- Authorization - (student and alumni).
- Alumni can post, internships, jobs and collaboration for the companies where they are working.
- Students can ask for referrals.
- Alumni can fund for something (payment system integration).
- Every college should have administrator or some admin to manages its own student.
- Students can collabs in Alumni project or work if they have posted like some research, or the project the faculty teachers have some project he/she will be working on. it is private to that university or on the control of that alumni.
- If university student is organizing some events he can ask for the funds directly to the alumni - administrator should verify that event or that person request and alumni can transfer fund.

# Problem we can face

- While Authentication - How we verify that this is correct student or alumni
- While asking for donation or fund for any activities administrator should give the permission that yes, this request is genuine.
- What type of collaboration- we have to decide it.
- In the fund section - how should payment is completed securely- to decide it should be a centralized payment method or each Indvidual can add his own bank as needed.
